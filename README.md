# Stop Fake News Spreading

  

Stop Fake News Spreading is a Google chrome extension. This application displays trustworthiness of a page (article mentioned in the website) depending upon the feedback of citizens and official authorities.

Beauty of it is that it involves citizens and authorities to work hand in hand in stopping the spread of fake news related to COVID19 and in general fake news itself. A chrome web application centrally maintained by the authorities provides so called trustworthiness rating for individual websites. Users can refer to the current rating of the site and use discretion before referring the content to their family and friends. This way citizens are given responsibility of building communities based on facts. Citizens can even contribute to increase or decrease the existing website rating and in turn participate in stopping of spread of fake news.
